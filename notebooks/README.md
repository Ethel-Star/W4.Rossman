# Customer Purchasing Behavior Analysis

## Project Overview

This project explores customer purchasing behavior using various features, such as promotions, store types, competitor distance, and holidays, to understand patterns and trends that affect sales. The analysis also aims to examine how external factors (like promotions or competitors) influence customer behavior, and provides insights into the effectiveness of store promotions, holidays, and assortment strategies.

## Goals

- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and outliers to ensure accurate results.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and analyze customer behavior before, during, and after promotions, holidays, store openings, etc.
- **Feature Importance**: Use machine learning models to identify key factors influencing customer purchasing behavior.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Develop models to predict future sales using past sales data.

## Key Questions

1. How are promotions distributed between the training and test sets?
2. How does sales behavior vary before, during, and after holidays?
3. What seasonal trends (Christmas, Easter, etc.) are present in purchasing behavior?
4. What is the correlation between sales and the number of customers?
5. How does the presence of promotions affect sales and customer behavior?
6. Are promotions more effective in certain stores, and can they be better deployed?
7. How does store opening/closing times impact customer purchasing behavior?
8. What is the effect of store assortment type on sales?
9. How does the distance to the nearest competitor affect sales?
10. What happens when a new competitor opens near a store?
